# Pulse Notifier - Yad al Hadofek - DevNation Hackathon 2020

This application uses your smartwatch to detect anomalies in your vital signs. 
When a rape victim is under drug influence or is under extreme stress & panic is it known that their heartrate changes drastically. For example, Rohpynol, the most common rape drug
causes the hearrate of the victim to decrease dramatically within 2 minutes of its' consumption.


Our app, once it has detected a drastic change in vitals, will start recording sounds, gps location and will alert the police.
To prevent detection of false positives, before the app starts acting, the watch will vibrate to alert the user.

If the user fails to dismiss the alert, the app will continue start recording audio, gps etc..
This feature comes extermly handy in cases of a victim that 'freezes' while being assaulted.
