# Pulse Notifier - Yad al Hadofek - DevNation Hackathon 2020

This application uses your smartwatch to detect anomalies in your vital signs. 
When a rape victim is under drug influence or is under extreme stress & panic is it known that their heartrate changes drastically. For example, Rohpynol, the most common rape drug
causes the hearrate of the victim to decrease dramatically within 2 minutes of its' consumption.
In addition, many rape/sexual assualt victims 'freeze' whenever they are being assaulted and therefore can't call for help. 


Our app, once it has detected a drastic change in vitals, will start recording sounds, gps location and will alert the police.
To prevent detection of false positives (for example, working out, being under alot of stress and such), before the app starts acting, the watch will vibrate to notify the user about it's intentions to call for help.

If the user fails to dismiss the notification, the app will start the aforementioned process.
